Session control application for simple public PC

This application provides basic control of sessions. It will display Terms and
Conditions when a session is started, giving the user 2 minutes to agree. If
the user disagrees with the terms and conditions, or fails to respond in the 2
minutes, the session is terminated. If the user agrees to the terms and
conditions, they will have 30 minutes before the session is terminated, with a
reminder to save work to a USB drive 5 minutes before the end of the session.
